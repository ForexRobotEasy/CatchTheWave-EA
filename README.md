# CatchTheWave EA

CatchTheWave EA is an expert advisor for MetaTrader 5 that aims to automate trading based on technical indicators and market analysis. This EA is not developed by ForexRobotEasy, but we provide a sample code that can work as described in this product. To find the official developer of this product, please use MQL5.

## Features
- Fully automated trading
- Adjustable take profit and stop loss values
- Customizable lot size for trading
- Grid trading strategy with adjustable grid size
- Entry points based on technical indicators and market analysis

## Input Parameters
- TakeProfit: the desired take profit value for each order (default: 100)
- StopLoss: the desired stop loss value for each order (default: 50)
- LotSize: the lot size for each trading order (default: 0.01)
- GridSize: the grid size for the grid trading strategy (default: 20)

## How it Works
The CatchTheWave EA follows a simple logic to execute trading orders. When there are open positions, it checks each order's profit and closes the order if it reaches the take profit or stop loss values.

If there are no open positions, the EA determines the entry points based on technical indicators and market analysis. In this sample code, the entry price is calculated using the Simple Moving Average indicator (SMA).

The EA then opens grid orders in both buy and sell directions. It calculates the price for each order based on the entry price and the grid size. The orders are placed with the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit values.

## Product Description
CatchTheWave EA is an expert advisor designed for MetaTrader 5, aiming to automate trading based on technical indicators and market analysis. This EA utilizes a grid trading strategy, opening both buy and sell orders at specific price levels.

With adjustable take profit and stop loss values, traders can customize their risk-reward ratio according to their trading preferences. The lot size can also be adjusted to accommodate different account sizes and risk levels.

The grid trading strategy implemented in CatchTheWave EA allows for potential profit opportunities in ranging markets. By taking advantage of price fluctuations, this EA aims to capture profit from both upward and downward movements.
